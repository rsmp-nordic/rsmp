# Message distribution

Proxy - - Distributor --> Receivers

A proxy distributes messages to receivers, when they are installed.

Collectors are special receiverws that waits for specific message, and are used to implement methods for waiting for RMSP responses, statuses, alarms, etc.

Note that Archive is not a receiver, and does not receive messages via the Distributor. Instead the Archive gets and stores messages via the log() interface in the Logging module. The reason is that the items that the Archive and the Logger contain other data as well as the message, like error messages, warnings, text descriptions, colors codes, etc. The Distributor and Receiver handles only Message objects.
