          Cycle time.
          Cycle time (or cycle length) is the sum of all phases in a time plan (traffic program). This time is fixed when using fixed time control or coordination (except "local coordination"). When the cycle counter reaches this length it is reset back to zero.
          Changing the cycle time can be used as part of scenario based control.

          Trigger level sensitivity for loop detector.
          The trigger level sensitivity determines at what level the loop detector should trigger. If it set too low then then traffic will not be detected as intended. If it is set too high the detector might give false positives.
          Can be used to make sure that the detectors detect traffic as intended.

          Used for area-based control where a command can be sent to a master traffic light controller about which predefined traffic situation to use (1-255).
          Traffic situation is a concept used to divide multiple TLC's into areas and sub-areas. The traffic situation gives the possibility to change the TLC sub-area dynamically depending on the time of day and the traffic flow. Depending on the traffic situation each TLC selects the time plan dynamically.

          Although this command is intended to be used with coordination it is not actually specified to be used for this yet. It is reserved in the SXL for possible future use.
          Intended for use with coordination of signaling systems where a traffic light controller communicates with neighboring controllers.
          Only used when a primary controller orders signal group of other controller to green or red (Coordination with external control bits).
          May also include purposes for adaptive control where a UTC system or a local traffic light controller takes over the phase control (stage control).
